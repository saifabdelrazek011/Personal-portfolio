export const HERO_CONTENT: string = `
I'm Saif Abdelrazek, a Highschooler, a frontend developer, instructor, and problem-solver passionate about web development, STEM education, and tackling real-world challenges. From leading teams to innovating for a better world, I turn ideas into impactful digital experiences.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT: string = `I’m a frontend developer, STEM educator, and active volunteer dedicated to making a difference through technology, education, and community service. As the Software Instructor at Gharbiya Fablab, I lead a team in designing intuitive web interfaces while also contributing to hands-on engineering projects.

Beyond coding, I’m a Physics, Math, and Geology instructor, helping students grasp complex scientific concepts. My passion for giving back led me to become a dedicated volunteer at Resala STEM, where I was recognized as the top contributor in Gharbiya Governorate and awarded a silver medal for being among the top 2% of volunteers in Season 2024. Through Resala STEM and the "Keep It Green" initiative, I’ve worked on environmental awareness campaigns, tree-planting efforts, and educating the public on pollution and sustainability.

From competing in Intel ISEF and NASA Space Apps to working on real-world solutions for air filtration, plastic waste, and energy generation, my mission is to build, teach, and give back. I believe that technology and education go hand in hand in shaping a better future—and I’m always excited to take on new challenges that make an impact.`;
